# Snakemake
Snakemake sets itself apart from existing text-based workflow systems in the following way. Hooking into the Python interpreter, Snakemake offers a definition language that is an extension of Python with syntax to define rules and workflow specific properties. This allows to combine the flexibility of a plain scripting language with a pythonic workflow definition. The Python language is known to be concise yet readable and can appear almost like pseudo-code. The syntactic extensions provided by Snakemake maintain this property for the definition of the workflow. Further, Snakemakeâ€™s scheduling algorithm can be constrained by priorities, provided cores and customizable resources and it provides a generic support for distributed computing (e.g., cluster or batch systems). Hence, a Snakemake workflow scales without modification from single core workstations and multi-core servers to cluster or batch systems.
